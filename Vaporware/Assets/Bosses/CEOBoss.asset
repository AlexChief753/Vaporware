  description: The head honcho of the Vaporware Corporation. He will test your skills,
    using the skills of the previous rivals you've faced! Starts by spawning  lines
    from the bottom and columns on top depending on how tall your stack is.  Second
    phase will spawn single tiles across your board, combined with lines from the
    bottom of the grid. During the final phase, speed increases, garbage will spawn
    if you don't clear lines often enough, and the boss will rapidly spawn dangerous
    lines from the bottom after 30 seconds!
