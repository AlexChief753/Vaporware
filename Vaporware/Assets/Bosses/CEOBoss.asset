  description: The head honcho of the Vaporware Corporation. He will test your skills,
    using the skills of the previous rivals you've faced! Starts by spawning columns
    and lines from the bottom depending on how tall your stack is.  Second phase
    will spawn single tiles across your board, combined with lines from the bottom
    of the grid. During the final phase, speed increases, garbage will spawn if you
    don't clear lines often enough, and the boss will rapidly spawn dangerous lines
    from the bottom after 30 seconds!
